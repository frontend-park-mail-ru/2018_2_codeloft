    <p class="rules-text">In our game you will play for a motorcyclist, 
    which leaves a bright trace. Other players or bots will also
     draw a line for themselves, and your task is to avoid contact with this line,
      regardless of whether it's yours or not. Also, in order to win, you must draw a 
    line so that opponents can not avoid your trace. On the playing field will be spawned
     various bonuses that will help you win. So do not yawn!</p>
